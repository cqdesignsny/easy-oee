# HANDOFF — Pick this up on a different machine

> **You are switching machines mid-build.** Read this top-to-bottom before doing anything else. Everything you need to continue is in this repo. Last updated: 2026-05-08 (project transfer to Louis's `easyoeepro` Vercel team + Stripe + Clerk + AI Gateway + Job Orders + AI Coach).

## State of the world right now

### Ownership and infrastructure
- ✅ **Project lives on Louis's `easyoeepro` Vercel team** (transferred 2026-05-08 from `cq-marketings-projects`). Domain `easy-oee.com` followed the project. CI/CD auto-deploys from `main` on the new team.
- ✅ **Cesar (`cqdesignsny@gmail.com`) is added as a Member** on `easyoeepro`. Use `vercel switch easyoeepro` then `vercel link --yes --project easy-oee` after pulling the SSD onto a new machine.
- ✅ **Fresh Neon DB** provisioned via Marketplace on the new team (`easy-oee-db` on the `aws-us-east-1` host). All data migrated cleanly via `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` — row counts (7 companies / 9 users / 9 lines / 27 shifts / 54 stops / 1 demo_lead / 4 migrations) match the source DB exactly. The OLD Neon project on `cq-marketings-projects` is idle but still alive as a safety net — decommission via "Remove Integration" once you're 24-48h confident on the new one.
- ✅ **Vercel Pro** active on `easyoeepro`. AI Gateway enabled with $5 free credits attached.
- ✅ **Vercel CLI** at 53.2.0 (latest as of 2026-05-08).

### Integrations live
- ✅ **AI Gateway** — both AI call sites route through `@ai-sdk/gateway`. No more `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in env. AI Coach uses `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` with prompt-cache control on the system message; daily digest narrative uses `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`. OIDC auth on Vercel; `vercel env pull` provides a 12h token for local.
- ✅ **Stripe (live mode)** — fully wired against Louis's "Easy OEE Pro" account (`acct_1TRaMUBt1JkiFLKl`). `/api/checkout/session` creates a subscription Checkout Session with `quantity = lineCount`; `/api/webhooks/stripe` handles `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.{created,updated,deleted}`, and `invoice.payment_failed`. New `/dashboard/billing` lets a manager pick a plan + line count and start the checkout. Trial banner Upgrade button now points there.
- ✅ **Clerk (test mode)** — alongside the legacy HMAC password flow. `/auth/sign-up` and `/auth/sign-in` use Clerk's hosted components (Email + Google + Microsoft). After sign-up, `/onboarding` collects company info and creates the local DB rows. After sign-in, `/post-clerk-signin` looks up the local user, sets the HMAC `eo_admin` cookie (so every existing `getAdminSession()` call keeps working), and forwards to `/dashboard`. Existing legacy `/sign-up` and `/sign-in` (HMAC password) still work — gradual migration.

### Product modules
- ✅ **AI Coach** at `/dashboard/analytics/ai-coach` — Mondays at 11:00 UTC the cron generates 3 prioritized action plans per tenant. Manager can also click Generate / Regenerate on demand. Approve / Edit / Reject each action. JSON stored on `company.ai_coach_report`. Available to all plans (no plan gate — it's the conversion hook).
- ✅ **Job Orders** at `/dashboard/analytics/jobs` — list + per-order detail page, rolls up shifts by `shift.job_number`. CSV export at `/api/analytics/jobs/[jobNumber]/export`. Available to all plans.
- ✅ **Per-line pricing**: Starter **$83 USD / line / month** (≈ $114 CAD), Pro **$129 USD / line / month** (≈ $177 CAD). Enterprise custom. AI Coach + Job Orders included on every tier; Pro adds analytics deep-dives + 90-day history + 5 ops/line vs 3 ops/line.
- ✅ **Plant-timezone correctness everywhere** — `src/lib/time.ts` is the single source of truth (`plantDateString`, `formatPlantDate`, `formatPlantTime`, `formatPlantDateTime`, `formatPlantDateTimeMachine`, `plantDayStartUTC`).
- ✅ **CSV export** machine-readable in plant-tz with explicit Timezone row.
- ✅ **Manager Settings page** at `/dashboard/settings` — change plant name + IANA timezone with live "now" preview.
- ✅ **Analytics module** at `/dashboard/analytics` — overview + by shift / machine / operator / job / AI Coach.
- ✅ **Light / dark theme toggle** on every surface (segmented control with both labels visible).
- ✅ **Sales demo** at `/demo` — Manager + Operator no-login entry into the seeded Maple Manufacturing tenant.
- ✅ **Live machines grid** on `/dashboard` — auto-refresh 10s.
- ✅ **Barcode/QR scanner** for job numbers + clipboard utility.
- ✅ **All Tier 1-4 product upgrades** still live: live shift timers, downtime card, long-stop notes, hand-off, shift comparison, loss tree, calendar grid, edit-shift, TV Board, daily digest cron, weekly anomaly cron, PWA manifest.
- ✅ Schema is in sync with Neon (auto-applied via `prebuild` migration runner). 4 migrations applied: 0000 baseline, 0001 user.password_hash, 0002 shift.job_number, 0003 ai_coach columns.
- ✅ Verification suite: `pnpm test` 30/30, typecheck clean, lint clean, full production build clean.

### Pending
- 🟡 **Smoke-test Stripe end-to-end** — sign up a test tenant, click Upgrade, complete Stripe Checkout with a real card, verify webhook flips `subscription_status=active`, refund yourself.
- 🟡 **Smoke-test Clerk sign-up** — `/auth/sign-up`, complete, land on `/onboarding`, fill form, end up on `/dashboard`.
- 🟡 **Rotate the Stripe secret + Stripe webhook secret + Clerk secret** — all four were visible in chat at some point during wiring. Roll them in their respective dashboards (Stripe → API keys → Roll; Stripe → Webhooks → ⋯ Roll signing secret; Clerk → API Keys → Regenerate). Paste new values back; they get pushed to Vercel and a redeploy picks them up.
- 🟡 **Resend** — `src/server/actions/shift-export.ts` is still the `console.log` stub. Need to verify `easy-oee.com` sending domain in Resend, grab API key, install SDK, write `src/emails/ShiftSummary.tsx` template, swap the `console.log`.
- 🟡 **Decommission old Neon** on `cq-marketings-projects` once 24-48h confidence on the new DB is reached.
- 🟡 **Migrate legacy HMAC trial users to Clerk** — currently both auth paths coexist. Eventually retire the HMAC code path and the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` demo backdoor.
- 🟡 Loading/error/404 states + Sentry still pending.

### To test the live app

1. **Quickest demo (no login):** https://easy-oee.com/demo → pick Manager or Operator
2. **New Clerk sign-up:** https://easy-oee.com/auth/sign-up → email/Google/Microsoft → onboarding → dashboard
3. **Legacy sign-up (HMAC password):** https://easy-oee.com/sign-up → email + password → trial dashboard
4. **Legacy demo password:** https://easy-oee.com/sign-in with any email + `EasyOEE2026Admin` → seeded Maple Manufacturing tenant
5. **Stripe checkout test:** sign up any way, click Upgrade in trial banner → `/dashboard/billing` → Subscribe with Stripe → real card, refund after
6. **Operator tablet flow:** https://easy-oee.com/pin → Pierre Lavoie, PIN `1234`

## ⚡ Canonical working path (portable SSD)

The project now lives on the **CQ-PRO-4TB external SSD** so it's portable across machines:

```
/Volumes/CQ-PRO-4TB/Easy OEE/
├── easy-oee/                    ← THE REPO (work here)
├── easy-oee-master.md           ← original Bubble-era spec (reference only)
├── easy-oee-project-brief.md    ← original brief (reference only)
└── Project Blueprint.docx
```

**On any new machine:** plug in the SSD, `cd "/Volumes/CQ-PRO-4TB/Easy OEE/easy-oee"`, and you're working in the same checkout. No re-cloning needed. `git pull` to sync with GitHub before starting.

> ⚠️ **Do NOT clone this repo into Dropbox.** node_modules + .next will thrash Dropbox sync and melt your CPU. The SSD is the canonical location now. If you ever need a non-SSD workspace, use `~/Code/easy-oee` instead.

---

## TL;DR — what to do on a new machine

**Auto-sync is live.** Every commit auto-pushes; every 3 minutes the SSD pulls
from origin. You don't need `git pull`/`git push` manually — just work.

```bash
# 1. Plug in CQ-PRO-4TB SSD, cd into the repo
cd "/Volumes/CQ-PRO-4TB/Easy OEE/easy-oee"

# 2. Install the auto-sync hook + launchd agent (one-shot)
./scripts/install-sync.sh

# 3. Install the Node toolchain — sudo-free, into ~/.local
#    (No Homebrew, no admin rights, no touching system paths.)
mkdir -p ~/.local && cd ~/.local
curl -fsSL https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.20.0/node-v22.20.0-darwin-arm64.tar.xz -o n.tar.xz
tar -xf n.tar.xz && rm n.tar.xz && mv node-v22.20.0-darwin-arm64 node
cat >> ~/.zshrc <<'EOF'

# Easy OEE toolchain (user-local, no sudo)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/node/bin:$PATH"
export npm_config_cache="$HOME/.local/npm-cache"
EOF
source ~/.zshrc
mkdir -p ~/.local/npm-cache

# 4. Install pnpm + vercel globally via the bundled npm
#    (Use the direct npm-cli.js path to bypass the corepack shim.)
node ~/.local/node/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js install -g pnpm@10 vercel

# 5. Back to the repo, install project deps, run verification
cd "/Volumes/CQ-PRO-4TB/Easy OEE/easy-oee"
pnpm install
pnpm test       # → 11/11 OEE math tests
pnpm typecheck  # → clean
pnpm lint       # → clean
pnpm build      # → full production build clean

# 6. (Optional) pull env vars from Vercel for local dev against Neon
vercel link --yes --project easy-oee
vercel env pull .env.local

# 7. Run it
pnpm dev        # → http://localhost:3000
```

Then open `docs/ROADMAP.md` and continue from the first 🟡/⚪ task. Or jump straight to the **"Resume here"** section at the bottom of this file.

### Why the toolchain dance?

Homebrew wants sudo. This project ships on a **bare user account without admin
rights**, so we install Node directly from the nodejs.org tarball into `~/.local`.
Three gotchas that will waste your time if you don't know about them:

1. **Node version matters:** you need **22.20+** (or any ≥ 22.12). Node 22.11
   doesn't allow `require(esm)`, which makes `pnpm test` crash inside vitest's
   `std-env` import. 22.20 is the known-good version.
2. **`~/.npm` is probably broken** (owned by uid 501:20 from a previous admin
   install). Don't `sudo chown` it — just set `npm_config_cache=~/.local/npm-cache`
   in your shell profile, which we do above.
3. **Corepack shim breaks the pnpm install.** Node's bundled `npm` is a corepack
   shim that tries to fetch a newer pnpm version and fails on signature
   verification. Bypass it by calling `node ~/.local/node/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js`
   directly (as shown in step 4).

Once the toolchain is up, everything in `package.json` Just Works.

## Cross-machine sync

The SSD working copy is kept continuously in sync with `origin/main`:

- **Post-commit hook** (`.git/hooks/post-commit`) — every `git commit` triggers
  `scripts/auto-sync.sh` in the background, which pushes immediately.
- **launchd agent** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cqdesigns.easyoee.autosync.plist`)
  — runs `scripts/auto-sync.sh` every 3 minutes and once at login.
- **`scripts/auto-sync.sh`** (in repo, travels with the SSD):
  PID-locked single-instance, auto-commits stray local changes as
  `auto-sync: working changes from <hostname>`, runs
  `git pull --rebase --autostash`, pushes if ahead, logs to `.git/auto-sync.log`,
  pops a macOS notification on failure.
- **`scripts/install-sync.sh`** — one-command setup for a new Mac. Installs the
  hook, copies + loads the launchd plist, sets `git config --global
  credential.helper osxkeychain`, runs an initial sync.

Just plug the SSD into either Mac, run `./scripts/install-sync.sh` once, and
forget about `git pull`/`git push` forever. Both machines stay in sync within 3
minutes of any change.

If something goes sideways: `tail -f "/Volumes/CQ-PRO-4TB/Easy OEE/easy-oee/.git/auto-sync.log"`.

## What's done ✅

### Foundation
- Next.js 16 scaffold with TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, Turbopack
- Bebas Neue / DM Sans / DM Mono via `next/font/google`
- pnpm + Vitest + Drizzle Kit set up
- Vercel project linked, GitHub repo connected, prod deploys on every push to `main`
- Build is clean: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build` all pass

### OEE math (`src/lib/oee.ts`)
- `computeOEE()` — pure function, all edge cases handled
- `formatPercent()`, `oeeBucket()` helpers
- **11/11 unit tests passing** — covers happy path, zero-planned, zero-parts, zero-rate, over-stop, perf cap
- Documented in `docs/OEE_MATH.md`

### Database schema (`src/lib/db/schema.ts`)
Drizzle schema with these tables — all multi-tenant via `company_id`, all structurally bug-proof against the four Bubble bugs:
- `company` (tenants)
- `user` (managers via Clerk + operators via PIN, both in one table with `role`)
- `line` (production lines)
- `shift` (one production run, with the snapshotted `idealRate` + computed OEE columns)
- `stop` (downtime events, FK to shift, `minutes` computed server-side on close)
- `device` (Phase 4 hardware ingest stub)
- `demo_lead` (marketing /contact form leads)

`src/lib/db/client.ts` is a **lazy** Drizzle/Neon client — won't crash at build time if `DATABASE_URL` is missing.

### Marketing site (`src/app/(marketing)/`)
Ported **1:1 from the live easy-oee.com** with the latest teal/cyan design:

- Palette: `--black: #003038` / `--white: #EFF5F9` / `--accent: #03BFB5` / `--red: #018076` / `--mid: #004146`
- `/` — full landing page (hero with "YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR REAL OEE", stats bar, problem + dashboard mock, solution with pills + pullquote, how-it-works, features, social proof, pricing teaser with ROI box, CTA band)
- `/pricing` — Starter / Professional / Enterprise CAD tiers (basic version, may need restyling to match new teal palette)
- `/contact` — demo request form, server action → `demo_lead` table, Zod validated. **Will throw at runtime until Neon is provisioned** (since the insert needs a real DB).

Components:
- `src/components/marketing/SiteNav.tsx` — How It Works / Features / Pricing / ROI Calculator / Book a Demo
- `src/components/marketing/SiteFooter.tsx` — Made in Canada 🍁
- `src/components/marketing/FadeIn.tsx` — single IntersectionObserver that mirrors the live site's `.fi/.on` scroll-in animation

Styles live in `src/app/globals.css` — the entire CSS from the live site, ported with `var(--font-bebas)` etc. instead of Google Font links.

### Project documentation (`docs/`)
- `README.md` — public overview
- `PROJECT.md` — full product/business context
- `AGENTS.md` (= `CLAUDE.md`) — coding conventions for AI agents
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design + decisions
- `docs/SCHEMA.md` — database tables and indexes (might be slightly out of sync — schema source of truth is `src/lib/db/schema.ts`)
- `docs/OEE_MATH.md` — math reference + test canon
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — phased plan, **the live build plan, update this as you ship**
- `docs/HARDWARE-INTEGRATION.md` — Phase 4 PLC ingest design
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — this file

## Open work — pick up here 👇

### Immediate next steps (in this exact order)

#### 1. Provision Neon Postgres + run first migration
```bash
# Easiest: via Vercel Marketplace, which auto-injects DATABASE_URL
# Option A — through the Vercel dashboard:
#   vercel.com → easy-oee project → Storage → Create Database → Neon → "Easy OEE Dev"
#   (creates a free dev branch, auto-adds DATABASE_URL to all envs)
#
# Option B — CLI (faster):
vercel link --yes --project easy-oee   # if not already linked
# Then go to dashboard for the marketplace flow ^^

# After provisioning, pull env vars locally:
vercel env pull .env.local

# Generate the first migration from schema:
pnpm db:generate
# (creates files in drizzle/)

# Push schema to Neon (dev iteration — no migration history needed yet):
pnpm db:push

# Or properly run migrations:
pnpm db:migrate

# Sanity check with Drizzle Studio:
pnpm db:studio
```

After this, the **/contact form will actually save leads** — test it locally then redeploy.

#### 2. Seed demo data
Create `src/lib/db/seed.ts` that idempotently inserts:
- 1 Company: "Maple Manufacturing"
- 2 Lines: "Machine 1" (idealRate 120), "Machine 2" (idealRate 60)
- 1 Manager user
- 1 Operator user with PIN 1234
- A few historical Shifts with computed OEE so the dashboard isn't empty

Add `"db:seed": "tsx src/lib/db/seed.ts"` to package.json scripts.

#### 3. Build the operator shift flow

Routes (under `src/app/(app)/`):
- `/operator` — start shift form: pick line, shift type (Morning/Afternoon/Night), product, planned minutes (default 480), ideal rate (defaults from line). Server action: `startShift()` → insert Shift, redirect to `/shift/[id]`.
- `/shift/[id]` — live tracking. Big machine status indicator. 10 stop reason buttons in a 2-column grid (use `STOP_REASONS` from `src/lib/stop-reasons.ts`). Good/bad parts +1/+10 buttons. End Shift button. Use `useOptimistic` for tap responsiveness.
  - Server actions: `logStop(shiftId, reason)`, `closeStop(stopId)`, `updateParts(shiftId, type, delta)`, `endShift(shiftId)`.
  - `endShift()` MUST call `computeOEE()` from `src/lib/oee.ts` and write the four metrics + `status='complete'` to the row in one transaction.
- `/shift/[id]/summary` — read-only OEE breakdown with color-coded factors via `oeeBucket()`.

Convention reminder (from `AGENTS.md`):
- Operator screens are **glove-friendly** — minimum 56px tap targets, big type, high contrast
- Default to Server Components, only `"use client"` when you actually need interactivity
- Every query through `withTenant(companyId)` (helper not yet written — create it in `src/lib/db/scoped.ts` when you need it)

#### 4. Build the manager dashboard
Route: `/dashboard` (the placeholder page already exists at `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Big "Today's OEE" number for the company
- Live shifts panel (in-progress shifts with current OEE estimate, polled via `revalidate = 10`)
- Recent shifts table (last 10) with color-coded OEE
- Top stop reasons today (Pareto-style horizontal bars)
- Sidebar nav: Dashboard / Lines / Operators / Shifts / Settings

#### 5. Wire Clerk auth
Defer until #1–4 are working with the seeded demo company. Then:
- `pnpm add @clerk/nextjs` (already installed)
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.local` and Vercel
- Add `<ClerkProvider>` to root layout
- Create `src/middleware.ts` with Clerk middleware scoped to `(app)` routes only
- Create `(auth)/sign-in/[[...rest]]/page.tsx` and `(auth)/sign-up/[[...rest]]/page.tsx`
- Webhook handler at `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` — on `user.created`, create a Company and set `publicMetadata.companyId`

#### 6. Wire operator PIN session
- Build `/pin` page: name picker + 4-digit PIN entry
- `src/lib/auth/operator-session.ts` — sign/verify HTTP-only cookie containing `{ operatorId, companyId, exp }`
- Use `OPERATOR_SESSION_SECRET` env var (32+ random chars)

### Things to remember while you build

1. **Never calculate OEE outside `src/lib/oee.ts`** — it's tested, just call `computeOEE()`.
2. **Every DB query must scope by `company_id`** — write a `withTenant()` helper as soon as you need it.
3. **Server Actions over API routes** for mutations. API routes only for webhooks + the future `/api/ingest`.
4. **`pnpm db:push` before `pnpm db:generate`** — push for dev iteration, generate when you want to lock a migration.
5. **Update `docs/ROADMAP.md`** as you finish tasks. Update `PROJECT.md` if a product decision changes.

## Files you should NOT need to touch (unless rewriting features)

- `src/lib/oee.ts` + `src/lib/oee.test.ts` — OEE math, locked-in
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — DB schema (edit + `pnpm db:generate` if you add tables)
- `src/lib/stop-reasons.ts` — the 10 standardized stop reasons
- `src/app/globals.css` — the entire ported design system from easy-oee.com (don't add Tailwind utilities to override these unless you know why)
- `src/components/marketing/*` — the marketing nav/footer/fade observer
- All `docs/*.md` — read-only context, but **update `ROADMAP.md` as you ship**

## Files you'll be touching next

- `src/app/(app)/operator/page.tsx` (create)
- `src/app/(app)/shift/[id]/page.tsx` (create)
- `src/app/(app)/shift/[id]/summary/page.tsx` (create)

## What got shipped today (2026-04-07 mega-batch)

After the initial Phase 1 core flow, the following was added in the same day:

**i18n (EN / ES / FR)**
- Full translation system: dictionaries (~200 keys × 3 languages), `LanguageProvider` (`useSyncExternalStore`-based, SSR-safe), server-side `getServerT()` helper that reads the `eo-locale` cookie, language switcher dropdown.
- Switching language calls `router.refresh()` so server components re-render with the new cookie.
- Wired into: nav, footer, homepage (all sections), how-it-works, roi-calculator, pricing, contact, privacy, terms, sign-in, pin, operator, live shift, summary, dashboard, manager nav.
- Switcher always visible in nav (desktop AND mobile next to hamburger), dashboard sidebar, sign-in page.

**Branding**
- `public/easy-oee-logo.svg` wired across nav (56px), footer (72px), dashboard sidebar (42px), sign-in (56px), pin (56px), operator pages (42–48px).
- Favicon points to the same SVG.
- Animated hero gauge (`src/components/marketing/HeroGauge.tsx`) — pure SVG with CSS keyframe needle revving from 0 to max, bouncing twice, then resetting. Sized 600px (default) → 660px (1280+) → 720px (1440+) → 800px (1800+) on desktop, stacks above text on mobile (380px / 280px on small phones). Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- All buttons rounded to full pill (999px), card-style operator/parts/pin keys at 22px.

**Mobile**
- Hamburger menu in `SiteNav` with full-screen overlay, body scroll lock, closes on route change.
- Tables wrapped in `.card { overflow-x: auto }` so they scroll horizontally.
- Body baseline 17px, drops to 16px on mobile per ui-ux-pro-max.
- Sub-hero h1 clamps further on phones.

**Auth (temporary, until Clerk lands)**
- `/sign-in` admin login: email + password (any email, password from `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var), Google/Microsoft SSO buttons present as disabled placeholders. HMAC cookie session, 14-day TTL.
- Demo password: `EasyOEE2026Admin` (in Vercel env vars across all 3 environments).

**Stripe scaffold**
- `src/lib/pricing.ts` — single source of truth: USD prices, USD→CAD conversion (1.37), per-plan stripePriceId slot, monthlyCostUSD function.
- `/pricing` rebuilt: line-count slider, 3 tiers, USD primary with CAD reference shown as `≈ $X CAD/mo`, "Start Free Trial" buttons link to `/sign-up?plan=pro&lines=3`.
- `/sign-up` page (client component) with plan toggle, line slider, company name, work email, "START FREE TRIAL" button. Currently shows a "you're on the list" success state instead of redirecting to Stripe.
- `/api/checkout/session` and `/api/webhooks/stripe` route stubs returning 501. Documented exactly what to wire when Stripe is added.
- Schema additions: `company.stripe_subscription_id`, `stripe_price_id`, `licensed_lines`, `subscription_status`. Already pushed to Neon.

**Copy cleanup**
- All em/en dashes removed from user-facing strings.
- "No hardware" mentions removed across all 3 locales (hardware is now a future paid upsell — see new "Works on Any Device" feature card teasing it).
- Hero eyebrow: "Built for Canadian manufacturers" → "Built for smart manufacturers" (US launch incoming).
- Footer: maple leaf emoji removed, "Made in Canada" line removed, body text bumped to 17px white, links 16px.
- Generic emojis ★ ✓ 🍁 replaced with inline SVGs.

## Database migrations are now automatic

Anytime you change `src/lib/db/schema.ts`:

```bash
pnpm db:generate              # writes drizzle/000N_*.sql
git add drizzle/ && git commit -m "..."
git push                      # auto-sync handles this
```

On the next Vercel build, the `prebuild` script (`scripts/migrate.mjs`) walks
`drizzle/*.sql` in order, applies anything not yet recorded in `_eo_migrations`,
**then** runs `next build`. Atomic. Safe. The dashboard 500-on-deploy that
happened earlier today will not happen again.

To apply migrations manually (e.g. on a fresh dev branch):
```bash
pnpm db:migrate    # = node --env-file=.env.local scripts/migrate.mjs
```

## 2026-04-07 — Tier 1-4 product upgrades (live shift, dashboard, board mode, polish)

Massive single-session batch turning the live shift screen into a real-time
scoreboard, the manager dashboard into a decision-making surface, and adding
a public TV-board view that's the kind of thing that makes Easy OEE *spread*
inside a plant. All four tiers shipped with full EN/ES/FR i18n.

**Tier 1 — live shift screen** (`src/app/(app)/shift/[id]/live-shift.tsx`):
elapsed/projected/stop-time timers in big mono digits, live OEE estimate
ticking with target delta + color buckets, pulsing red downtime card with
the current-stop clock, long-stop note prompt that fires after 10+ minute
stops, hand-off button that lets the next operator slide in mid-shift with
their PIN (records `shift.endingOperatorId`, rotates the cookie).

**Tier 2 — manager dashboard** (`src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`): three
shift-type comparison cards (morning/afternoon/night, 7-day avg). Pareto
already shipped earlier. Daily digest cron at `/api/cron/daily-digest`
assembles per-line OEE + best/worst + top 3 stops + 7-day delta and
optionally calls Claude Haiku 4.5 for a 2-3 sentence narrative summary.
Weekly anomaly scan at `/api/cron/anomaly-scan` flags lines whose 7-day
avg dropped > 5pp vs the prior 4-week baseline. Both registered in
`vercel.json`. Auth via `x-vercel-cron` header or `Bearer CRON_SECRET`.

**Tier 3 — TV Board mode + loss tree:**
- `/board/[token]` is a public read-only fullscreen route designed for a
  55" display bolted above a line. No login. Manager rotates the token
  from `/dashboard/lines`. Big OEE numeral, RUNNING/STOPPED pill,
  operator + product subtitle, side panel with parts/elapsed/top-stops,
  idle state when no shift is active. Server revalidates every 10s,
  client keeps timers smooth and triggers `router.refresh()` between pulls.
- Loss-tree stacked-bar card on `/shift/[id]/summary`: partitions all
  planned minutes into Good Output / Quality Loss / Speed Loss / Downtime
  with a legend. Driven by new `computeLossTree()` in `src/lib/oee.ts`
  (2 new tests, 13/13 passing).

**Tier 4 — polish:**
- PWA manifest at `src/app/manifest.ts` — operators "Add to Home Screen"
  on a tablet, launches `/pin` standalone with the teal background and
  branded icons.
- Edit-shift workflow: `editShift()` server action + new
  `/dashboard/shifts/[id]/edit` page with audit-reason field. If shift is
  already complete, OEE numbers are recomputed automatically from the new
  values + existing stops.
- Calendar grid: "Last 14 Days · Calendar" card on `/dashboard/shifts`
  showing morning/afternoon/night × 14 days, color-coded by oeeBucket.
- Plant timezone column on company (`America/Toronto` default) — wired
  into the schema, ready for `getCompanyDay()` helper to use it.

**Schema additions** — all backwards compatible, push when convenient:

| Table     | Column                | Type                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `company` | `timezone`            | `text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'America/Toronto'`   |
| `line`    | `target_oee`          | `numeric(5,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.85`        |
| `line`    | `board_token`         | `text UNIQUE`                               |
| `shift`   | `ending_operator_id`  | `uuid REFERENCES user(id)`                  |

```bash
pnpm db:push   # apply to dev branch
```

**New env vars (all optional, all degrade gracefully):**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — turns on AI digest summaries via Claude Haiku 4.5
- `CRON_SECRET` — `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` for manual
  triggering of `/api/cron/*` from outside Vercel Cron

**i18n:** ~40 new keys × 3 languages (EN/ES/FR) covering all the new
strings on live shift, dashboard, summary, board.

**CSS additions** (`src/app/globals.css`): `.timer-row`,
`.progress-track`, `.liveoee-*`, `.downtime-card` (reduced-motion-aware
pulse), `.app-input`, `.loss-tree`, `.board-*`, `.shift-compare`,
`.calendar-grid`, `.cal-cell`.

**Verified clean:** `pnpm test` 13/13, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm build` all green.

## Late additions (2026-04-07 evening)

- **Cross-machine auto-sync** — see "Cross-machine sync" section above. Hook +
  launchd agent + `install-sync.sh`. Lives in `scripts/`.
- **Sudo-free toolchain** — Node 22.20 / pnpm 10 / Vercel CLI installed into
  `~/.local` on the bare iMac without Homebrew or admin rights. PATH persisted
  in `~/.zshrc`. See the "Why the toolchain dance?" callout in the TL;DR for
  the three gotchas (Node ≥ 22.12 required, broken `~/.npm` perms, corepack
  shim conflict).
- **Branded favicon + OG image** — `src/app/icon.tsx`, `apple-icon.tsx`,
  `opengraph-image.tsx` use `next/og` `ImageResponse` to generate PNGs at build
  time: the `easy-oee-logo.svg` centered on the `#003038` teal background.
  Sizes: 512×512 (favicon), 180×180 (Apple touch icon), 1200×630 (Open Graph
  for Slack/iMessage/Twitter/LinkedIn previews). The old default
  `src/app/favicon.ico` was deleted so the new icon convention wins everywhere.
- **Shift summary header buttons** — "Start New Shift" + "Dashboard" buttons
  moved from the bottom of `/shift/[id]/summary` to a flex row next to the
  page title for one-tap post-shift navigation. Wraps cleanly on phones; hidden
  in print output.
- **Vitest fix** — `@rolldown/binding-darwin-arm64` added as an explicit
  devDependency because pnpm 10 was filtering it out of rolldown's optional
  deps on Apple Silicon, breaking `pnpm test` startup. Lockfile now ships the
  binding so any arm64 Mac is good immediately.

## Late additions in the same session (post mega-batch)

- **Operator/live-shift/summary centering** — those three screens were full-width left-aligned (the `.op-shell` class doesn't constrain width). Now wrapped at `maxWidth: 880px` with auto margins so they sit centered on big monitors.
- **Language switcher on live-shift + summary** — was missing from those two screens, now in the header next to the logo.
- **Shift export** — new card at the bottom of `/shift/[id]/summary`:
  - **Download CSV** → `/api/shifts/[id]/csv` route handler (`src/app/api/shifts/[id]/csv/route.ts`). Auth-scoped to operator session OR admin session. Streams a full per-shift CSV: header info, OEE metrics, production detail, every downtime event with timestamps.
  - **Print or save PDF** → `window.print()`. New `@media print` block in `globals.css` hides `.no-print` chrome, switches body to white background + black text, adds borders to cards, prevents bad page breaks. Browser save-as-PDF gives a clean one-pager.
  - **Email it** → expands an inline form. Server action `emailShiftSummary` in `src/server/actions/shift-export.ts` validates the email + shift, currently returns a placeholder confirmation. To wire: install Resend, create `src/emails/ShiftSummary.tsx` React Email template, replace the `console.log` with `resend.emails.send()`. Env vars needed: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EASY_OEE_FROM_EMAIL`.
- All new export strings translated EN/ES/FR (`export.title`, `export.csv`, `export.print`, `export.email`, `export.send`, `export.sending`, `export.emailLabel`).

## What's left for the immediate next session

1. **Wire actual Stripe** — create products + prices in your Stripe dashboard, paste the price IDs into `src/lib/pricing.ts`, add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to Vercel env, replace the 501 stubs in `/api/checkout/session/route.ts` and `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` with real Stripe Checkout Session creation and webhook handling. Schema is already in place.
2. **Wire actual Resend** — `pnpm add resend @react-email/components`, create `src/emails/ShiftSummary.tsx`, add `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EASY_OEE_FROM_EMAIL` to Vercel env, swap the `console.log` in `src/server/actions/shift-export.ts` for `resend.emails.send({ from: process.env.EASY_OEE_FROM_EMAIL, to, subject, react: <ShiftSummary {...} /> })`. Then optionally trigger it automatically from `endShift()` for managers who opt in via a settings page.
3. **Wire actual Clerk** for managers — create Clerk app, paste keys, replace `/sign-in` admin password with Clerk sign-in. Replace `getManagerCompanyId()` (currently the seeded-tenant stub) with a Clerk session lookup. The `(auth)/sign-in` pattern is already set up in the URL.
4. **Loading and error states** — `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, on-brand 404 page.
5. **Sentry** for error tracking.
6. **Domain cutover** — point `easy-oee.com` from GitHub Pages to Vercel once you're confident the new app is the better landing.

## Resume here 👇 (the literal next thing to do — as of 2026-04-07)

**Current machine state (iMac `cqmarketing`):** Toolchain is now **fully
installed and verified** — Node 22.20 + pnpm 10 + Vercel CLI in `~/.local`,
auto-sync hook + launchd agent active, project deps installed, all
verification commands green (`pnpm test` 11/11, `pnpm typecheck` clean,
`pnpm lint` clean, `pnpm build` clean). Just plug in the SSD and start
working.

**On a fresh Mac that doesn't have any of this yet:** follow the TL;DR at the
top of this file (auto-sync setup → Node tarball → pnpm via direct npm-cli →
`pnpm install` → verify). It's a copy-paste sequence, no admin rights needed.

**Then:** Provision Neon Postgres via Vercel Marketplace (see "Open work" Step
1 below), `pnpm db:push`, write `src/lib/db/seed.ts`, then start the operator
flow.

**Known issues to investigate after auth:**
- Vercel preview URL `https://easy-fnqyp90da-cq-marketings-projects.vercel.app` returns **HTTP 401** — likely Vercel deployment protection / SSO. Disable in project Settings → Deployment Protection if you want public preview.
- `easy-oee.com` is currently served from **GitHub Pages** (Louis's static HTML), NOT Vercel. DON'T cut over DNS until app v1 is ready.
- Louis's contact-form leads from the live site: destination unknown. Fetch the live `contact.html` and inspect the form action to locate them (Formspree / Netlify Forms / email).

If anything looks wrong, the source of truth is the GitHub repo — the local copy you make should match. Re-clone if in doubt.

Good luck, future you. 🚀

## 2026-04-28 — Sales-ready batch (live demo, signup, live grid, scanner, mobile audit)

Single-day push to make the app demo-able to Louis's prospects and let real
trials start. Six commits, all green.

### What shipped

**1. `/demo` route — live sales demo with no login**
- Two entrypoints: **Enter as Manager** (lands on `/dashboard` with the seeded
  Maple Manufacturing tenant) and **Enter as Operator** (lands on `/operator`
  signed in as Pierre Lavoie).
- New `eo_demo` cookie + `setDemoCookie()` helper at
  `src/lib/auth/demo-mode.ts`. Server actions in `src/server/actions/demo.ts`
  set admin + operator cookies pointing at the seed user IDs and toggle the
  banner.
- Sticky **DEMO MODE** banner across every `(app)` route via the layout.
  Banner has a **Sign Up Free** CTA that pushes prospects to `/sign-up` and
  an Exit demo link. White button text on the dark pill — visibility bug
  fixed in commit `cb1750d`.
- Per-route tip card (`<DemoBanner />` is a client component using
  `usePathname()`) explains what the prospect is looking at on dashboard,
  lines admin, operators admin, shifts admin, operator setup, live shift,
  summary, and PIN entry.
- Marketing nav has a **See it Live** link going to `/demo`. Marketing CTA
  switched from "Book a Demo" → "Start Free Trial" pointing at `/sign-up`.
  Sign-in page also has a "Try the Live Demo" button.
- Every demo string in EN/ES/FR.

**2. `/sign-up` is now real — 7-day trial signup**
- Form creates a `company` row (slug auto-generated, plan `'trial'`,
  `trial_ends_at = now + 7 days`, `subscription_status = 'trialing'`) and a
  `user` row with `role = 'manager'` and a bcrypt `password_hash`.
- Sets the admin cookie (now carries `userId` + `companyId`) and redirects to
  `/dashboard`.
- Schema migration: `user.password_hash text` (nullable; null on operators).
  See `drizzle/0001_user_password_hash.sql`.
- `signInAdmin` updated to do an email + bcrypt lookup first, falling back to
  the legacy `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var which now resolves to the seed manager
  of Maple Manufacturing (kept as a backwards-compat backdoor — you can
  remove the env var when ready).
- New **trial countdown banner** at the top of `/dashboard` showing days
  remaining + a Choose a plan link. Hides itself when `trial_ends_at` is
  null. Red "expired" variant when the trial is past due.
- `getManagerCompanyId()` and the dashboard's company resolver now read from
  the admin session first, falling back to the seed for the legacy demo path.

**3. Live machines grid on `/dashboard`**
- New section above the existing widgets: per-line cards in a responsive
  CSS grid (auto-fill, min 280px). Each card shows running/stopped/idle
  pill, big OEE number, current operator, product, **job number** when
  set, parts, elapsed timer, current open stop with red highlight, top
  stop today.
- Backed by `getCompanyLiveLines(companyId)` in
  `src/lib/db/queries/line-state.ts` — multi-line version of the
  per-line snapshot the TV board uses.
- Client wrapper (`live-lines-grid.tsx`) ticks elapsed timers every
  second and triggers `router.refresh()` every 10s.

**4. Barcode / QR scanner — primary use is job numbers**
- `<ScanModal>` opens fullscreen camera. Tries native `BarcodeDetector`
  API first (Chrome/Edge/Safari TP), falls back to `@zxing/browser`.
  Releases stream cleanly on close. Handles permission denied + no
  camera gracefully.
- `<ScanButton targetInputId={...}>` — drop-in next to any input.
  When triggered, fills the named input. Used for the **Job Number**
  field on `/operator` (operator shift setup) and on `/dashboard/shifts/[id]/edit`.
- `<DashboardScanButton />` lives in the manager dashboard header next
  to Start Shift; scans → clipboard with a green "Copied!" toast.
- Schema: `shift.job_number text` (nullable). See
  `drizzle/0002_shift_job_number.sql`.
- Display: live shift header, summary header (`· Job WO-12345`),
  live machines grid card, dashboard recent shifts table, full shifts
  admin table, per-shift CSV export.

**5. Mobile responsiveness audit + fixes**
- Hamburger menu was effectively broken — only the first link rendered.
  Cause: `<nav>` has `backdrop-filter: blur(16px)` which silently makes
  it a containing block for any `position: fixed` descendant. The
  mobile menu was anchored to the 89px-tall nav instead of the
  viewport. Moved the menu out of `<nav>` as a sibling so its
  `position: fixed` resolves to the viewport.
- Dashboard header (`/dashboard`): switched the inline flex with
  `space-between` to a wrapping `.dash-header` / `.dash-header-actions`
  pair. Under 600px the title block stacks above the action buttons,
  Scan code button text no longer wraps to two lines.
- Manager sidebar (`(app)/dashboard/layout.tsx`): the lang switcher and
  Sign Out used to stack as two full-width blocks on mobile (sidebar
  collapses to top bar). Now wrapped in `.mgr-side-foot`; on mobile
  they sit inline and Sign Out is auto-width.
- Marketing copy: home + pricing trial mentions changed from 14-day to
  **7-day** in EN/ES/FR. The "14-day calendar grid" wording in the
  dashboard tip is correct and stays.
- Verified at 375×812: `/`, `/how-it-works`, `/pricing`,
  `/roi-calculator`, `/contact`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/pin`,
  `/demo`, `/dashboard`, `/operator`. All clean.

**6. Migration runner bug fix (root cause of an outage)**
- `scripts/migrate.mjs` `splitStatements()` filtered out any chunk
  whose first character was `--`, intending to skip commented-out
  statements. Both `0001_user_password_hash.sql` and
  `0002_shift_job_number.sql` opened with a doc-block comment header,
  so the entire file got dropped. The runner still recorded each
  migration as applied in `_eo_migrations`, so Drizzle's schema
  believed the columns existed but they didn't — every
  `db.select().from(s.user)` and `db.select().from(s.shift)` threw
  `column "..." does not exist`, which broke `/demo`, signup, and the
  dashboard.
- Fixed: a chunk is dropped only if stripping `-- comment` lines and
  whitespace leaves nothing executable. Files that open with a
  doc-block but contain real DDL are correctly applied.
- Production DB columns were added directly via
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` so the live deploy
  recovered immediately. The `_eo_migrations` entries still match.

### Schema additions (all backwards-compatible)

| Table | Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user` | `password_hash` | `text` (nullable) | bcrypt for manager email+password login. Null on operators. |
| `shift` | `job_number` | `text` (nullable) | Optional work-order / job ticket number, set on shift start or via manager edit. |

### New i18n keys (all 3 languages)

`signin.demoPrompt`, `signin.demoCta`, `signin.signupPrompt`,
`signin.signupLink`, full `signup.*` block, full `trial.*` block,
`nav.tryDemo`, `nav.startTrial`, full `demo.*` + `demo.banner.*` +
`demo.tip.*` blocks, full `dashboard.lines.*` block, `dashboard.col.job`,
`shift.job`, `operator.jobNumber*`, full `scan.*` block.

### Auth model summary (where we are pre-Clerk)

- **Operators** sign in at `/pin` with name + 4-digit PIN; bcrypt verify
  against `user.pin_hash`. HMAC-signed cookie `eo_op`, 12h TTL,
  payload `{ operatorId, companyId, exp }`. Unchanged.
- **Managers** sign in at `/sign-in` with email + password. New flow
  looks up the `user` by email, bcrypt-verifies `password_hash`. HMAC-signed
  cookie `eo_admin`, 14d TTL, payload `{ role: "admin", userId, companyId, exp }`.
  Falls back to the legacy `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var that grants access to the
  seed tenant — kept so older demo bookmarks still work.
- **Demo users** hit `/demo` and click an entry button. The server
  action sets both admin + operator cookies pointing at the seeded
  Maple Manufacturing user IDs and a marker `eo_demo` cookie that
  toggles the demo banner.
- **Self-serve signup** at `/sign-up` creates a fresh company + manager
  user (bcrypt password) and sets the admin cookie. 7-day
  `trial_ends_at` populated; Stripe wiring takes it from there.

### Files added today

.gitignore  (added .claude/)
```

### Resume here on the next session

Highest-leverage next steps in order:

1. **Wire actual Stripe** — schema fields are populated already
   (`stripe_subscription_id`, `licensed_lines`, `subscription_status`,
   `trial_ends_at`). Replace 501 stubs in
   `/api/checkout/session/route.ts` and `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
   with real Checkout Session + webhook handling. Fill in `stripePriceId`
   slots in `src/lib/pricing.ts`. Add `STRIPE_*` keys to Vercel env.
2. **Wire Resend** — server action `emailShiftSummary` already validates
   input. `pnpm add resend @react-email/components`, create
   `src/emails/ShiftSummary.tsx`, swap `console.log` for
   `resend.emails.send()` in `src/server/actions/shift-export.ts`. Add
   `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EASY_OEE_FROM_EMAIL` to Vercel env. Then optionally
   fire on shift end for managers who opt in.
3. **Migrate to Clerk** when you outgrow per-company HMAC. The current
   schema can co-exist with Clerk (`user.clerk_user_id` already exists);
   migrate is additive.
4. **Loading/error/404 states + Sentry** for production polish.
5. **Daily reset cron for the demo tenant** so prospects don't see each
   other's clicks. Wire `resetDemo()` to truncate non-seed shifts +
   stops on a daily schedule (cron path: `/api/cron/reset-demo`).
6. **Domain cutover** — point `easy-oee.com` from GitHub Pages to Vercel
   when you're ready to retire Louis's static HTML.

If anything looks wrong, the source of truth is GitHub. Re-clone if in
doubt. SSD canonical path is `/Volumes/CQ-PRO-4TB/Easy OEE/easy-oee`.
Auto-sync runs every 3 minutes + on every commit; Dropbox docs mirror is
wired into the same script and updates the same cycle.

## 2026-04-29 — Analytics module + light/dark theme + style sweep

Two features and a style pass landed in one commit (`5e1f298`).

### What shipped

**1. Analytics module at `/dashboard/analytics`**

Adapted from a spec Louis sent over. Four routes:

- `/dashboard/analytics` — KPI cards (OEE / Availability / Performance /
  Quality over the last 30 days), production volume cards (good parts,
  defective units, total + defect rate), 14-day SVG sparkline with the
  85% target line, and three drill-in cards.
- `/dashboard/analytics/shifts` — per-shift-type cards, full shift
  detail table, and Pareto stops broken out per shift type.
- `/dashboard/analytics/machines` — line summary table with vs-target
  column, OEE-vs-target horizontal bars (green when above, red below,
  vertical white tick at the target), and Pareto stops per line.
- `/dashboard/analytics/operators` — ranked leaderboard cards (#1 gets
  a teal rank pill), full detail table sorted by OEE, and Pareto stops
  per operator.

Backed by `src/lib/db/queries/analytics.ts` — multi-tenant queries
using Drizzle (`avg`, `count`, `sum`, `groupBy`). All queries scoped by
`companyId` and resolved through `getAdminSession()` with a seed
fallback for the legacy demo path.

Sub-nav at the top of every analytics route via
`src/app/(app)/dashboard/analytics/subnav.tsx`. Manager sidebar gets a
new **Analytics** tab between Dashboard and Shifts. Demo banner has
per-route tip cards for all four analytics pages.

Adaptations from Louis's draft (his structure was sound; the polish
needed cleanup):
- All decoration emojis stripped (icons, sun/moon, ✅/❌ in the cards).
- ~95 hardcoded Spanish strings lifted into i18n keys × EN/ES/FR.
- CSS fallback variables replaced with the real theme tokens
  (`--mid`, `--border`, `--border2`, `--accent`, `--white`,
  `--muted2`, `--font-dm-mono`, `--font-bebas`).
- Bucket class typo fixed (`oee-low`, not `oee-poor`).
- Stop reason labels reuse the canonical `stop.NN.label` keys instead
  of being duplicated three times.
- A small helpers file `src/app/(app)/dashboard/analytics/helpers.ts`
  with `getAnalyticsCompanyId()` and `STOP_LABEL_KEYS`.

**2. Light / dark theme toggle**

Wired through every surface. The dark theme is the existing brand teal
look; light theme flips background and text while keeping the same
teal accent.

- Tokens defined in `src/app/globals.css` for both
  `:root[data-theme="dark"]` and `:root[data-theme="light"]`. Smooth
  `transition` on background-color + color + border-color across body,
  cards, nav, sidebar, fields, buttons, scanner, banners.
- `src/lib/theme.ts` — `getServerTheme()` reads the `eo-theme` cookie
  via `next/headers`, defaulting to dark. Used by the root layout to
  set `data-theme` on `<html>` at SSR. No flash of wrong theme on
  first paint.
- `src/components/theme/ThemeToggle.tsx` — client component with two
  variants (`icon` round button, `labeled` with text). Sun/moon SVGs
  (no emoji glyphs). Clicking updates `data-theme`, sets the cookie
  (1-year max-age), and writes localStorage. Hydration-safe via the
  mounted-flag pattern (eslint-disable-next-line on the standard
  set-state-in-effect for the mount toggle).
- Wired into:
  - Manager sidebar bottom row (`mgr-side-foot`)
  - Operator setup (`/operator`)
  - `/sign-in`, `/pin`, `/demo` landing
  - Marketing nav (desktop links + mobile cluster)
- i18n: `theme.light`, `theme.dark`, `theme.toLight`, `theme.toDark`
  in all 3 locales.

**3. Style sweep — em-dashes, AI slop, decoration emojis**

- Em-dash pause-breaks replaced with periods in user-facing strings:
  `shift.longStop.title`, `demo.banner.tip`, `demo.manager.body` in
  EN/ES/FR.
- Em-dashes in JSDoc file headers cleaned (manifest, layout, csv
  route, cron routes, ThemeToggle, ScanModal, dictionaries header) —
  replaced with periods or colons.
- Decoration emojis: none found in user-facing strings. The only
  glyph left is `✓` in `seed.ts` console output — that's a CLI dev
  tool with structural meaning, kept.
- AI-slop phrases: none found.
- `"—"` is still used as a null-data placeholder in tables (e.g.,
  unset job number, no shift data). That's correct typography (the
  character represents absence of value, not a pause-break).

### Schema changes

None this round. Analytics is read-only.

### New i18n keys

About 100 keys × EN/ES/FR. Topical groups: `analytics.*` (overview,
KPI labels, sub-nav, column headers, drill-in card copy, per-page
empty states), `theme.*`, plus extra `demo.tip.analytics.*` for the
per-route demo banner tips, plus `mgr.nav.analytics`.

### Resume here on the next session

The "next steps" punch list from the 2026-04-28 entry still applies
(Stripe wiring, Resend wiring, Clerk migration, loading/error/404,
demo reset cron, DNS cutover). Two new items added by today's work:

1. **Add a "Per-line drill-down" deep-dive page** under
   `/dashboard/analytics/machines/[id]` — currently the machine
   summary is a flat list. A per-line page with daily trend +
   shift-by-shift table would round out Phase 3 "Insights".
2. **Theme-aware OG / favicon images** — current PNGs are dark only;
   light-theme users on iMessage previews will still see the dark
   teal background. Low priority but on the list.

Auto-sync runs every 3 min + on every commit. Dropbox docs mirror
follows the same cycle.

### Bug-fix addendum (same day)

After the initial analytics + theme push, four light/demo bugs surfaced
and were fixed:

- **Logo rendered twice in light mode.** `next/image` stamps
  `display: block` into the element's inline style, which beat the
  `display: none` from the `.logo-swap-light/-dark` classes. Fixed
  with `!important` on the swap rules. Without that, both variants
  rendered side-by-side.
- **Sidebar disappeared into the dark teal background in light mode.**
  `.mgr-side` had a hardcoded `background: #002328`. Replaced with a
  set of dedicated tokens (`--mgr-side-bg`, `--mgr-side-text`,
  `--mgr-side-muted`, `--mgr-side-border`, `--mgr-side-hover`,
  `--mgr-side-active-bg`, `--mgr-side-active-text`) so the sidebar can
  stay branded teal in dark mode and be a clean white card in light
  mode.
- **Sidebar wasn't connecting to the demo banner.** Banner is sticky
  at top:0 with z-index 50; sidebar was also sticky at top:0 with
  default z-index, so it disappeared behind the banner whenever the
  user scrolled past the page header. Added `--eo-sticky-top` CSS
  variable on `:root` (default 0px), bumped to 48px via
  `.app-shell:has(> .demo-banner)` rule. The sidebar now uses
  `top: var(--eo-sticky-top)` and `height: calc(100vh - var(--eo-sticky-top))`,
  visually connecting to the banner edge.
- **Per-route demo tip card spanned the full width above the sidebar**,
  pushing `.mgr-shell` (and the sidebar inside it) further down the
  document. The result was a visible gap between the banner and the
  sidebar's top edge. Hid the tip wrapper on routes that contain a
  `.mgr-shell` via `.app-shell:has(.mgr-shell) .demo-tip-wrap { display: none }`.
  The banner copy still conveys the message; tips remain on
  operator/shift/summary/pin where they fit better.
- Marketing nav and operator setup got the theme toggle alongside the
  language switcher. Logo component now renders both `easy-oee-logo.svg`
  (white ink) and `easy-oee-logo-dark.svg` (dark ink) and CSS swaps
  visibility based on `data-theme`. The marketing nav was migrated from
  raw `<Image>` to the shared `<Logo />` component for consistency.

Lightning CSS gotcha: dropped a `.app-shell:has(.mgr-shell) > .app-wrap:has(> .demo-tip)` rule silently during minification (nested `:has()` with child combinators). Worked around it by adding a `demo-tip-wrap` class directly to the wrapper and targeting that.

### Light-mode marketing nav + theme toggle redesign (same day, second pass)

After the bug-fix addendum landed, the marketing nav was still unreadable in light mode and the theme toggle was a single icon nobody could decode. Two more fixes:

- **Marketing nav now follows theme.** `.eo-nav` had a hardcoded
  `background: rgba(0, 48, 56, 0.96)` and `.nav-links a` used
  `var(--white)` for text. In light mode `--white` becomes dark teal,
  so dark text rendered on a hardcoded dark teal background — invisible.
  Replaced with `--nav-bg`, `--nav-text`, `--nav-border` tokens that
  flip with the theme. Dark mode keeps the dark teal blur; light mode
  becomes a near-white blur with dark text. Also tightened nav links
  to 15px with `white-space: nowrap` and reduced gap to 28px so they
  don't wrap awkwardly with the new theme toggle.
- **ThemeToggle is now a segmented two-option control.** Single icon
  was unclear (sun? moon? what does it do?). New UI is a pill with
  two labeled buttons: `[☀ Light] [🌙 Dark]`. Both visible always; the
  current theme has a teal background pill, the other is muted. Click
  either to set that theme. Compact variant (icons only) ships in the
  marketing mobile cluster where horizontal space is tight. Used
  everywhere else with full labels: manager sidebar, operator setup,
  sign-in, pin, demo landing, marketing desktop nav.
- New i18n key `theme.toggleLabel` ("Theme" / "Tema" / "Thème") for
  the `aria-label` on the segment group.
